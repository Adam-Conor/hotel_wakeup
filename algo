two threads {
	one to register wake up calls
	one to send wake up
}
keep track of wake up calls
generating a wake up is random room number and random wake up time
making a wake-up call is specified by how many seconds since Epoch
must use heap to store data(research to find how to do)
root is always the newest wake up call

random wake up call generated between 0 and 5 seconds
wake up calls random number between 0 100 seconds

must track what calls came in and what ones went out
